# Thanks to TheButterZone (191R9RaC4mUsc4mKAQPY1TBZc5JGRt13zp) for this script!
# This works under OSX 10.6.8-10.11.5, Adium 1.5.*, MacGPG2 2.0.*
# In Adium, you need to set your Freenode account options to run at least this command on connect: /join #bitcoin-otc
# There are 2 fields you need to replace: 
# YOURNICKGOESHERE, YOUR16DIGITGPGKEYIDGOESHERE
# "delay 30" is there to allow you time to type your GPG passphrase at the prompt and hit return. Hands off keyboard & mouse after you do that.
# Once you edit this script to your unique specs, save it as a run-only application.
# This will not work if gribble is lagging and doesn't generate a new OTP before the event that decrypts it. Increase delay '5' (seconds) if you don't mind waiting longer.
# If Terminal prompts because of running processes on quit, change Terminal Shell settings to Prompt before closing: *Never
# Only run this when Adium is already logged into Freenode.
