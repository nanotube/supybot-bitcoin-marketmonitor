    <h2 style="text-align: center;">OTC web of trust</h2>
    To complement the OTC marketplace, we offer a web of trust service. Due to the p2p nature of OTC transactions, you are exposed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_risk#Counterparty_risk">counterparty risk</a>. To mitigate this risk, you need to have access to your counterparty's reputation and trade history. This is precisely the kind of information that the OTC web of trust provides.

    <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>#bitcoin-otc is merely an aggregator of outstanding supply and demand. All transactions that may occur are conducted directly between counterparties, without any participation or intermediation from #bitcoin-otc. As such, it is each individual's responsibility to conduct due diligence on their counterparties, and otherwise act in a prudent way to avoid falling prey to fraudulent users. It is strongly recommended that all users review the <a href="https://wiki.bitcoin-otc.com/wiki/Using_bitcoin-otc">guide to using #bitcoin-otc</a>, which contains a non-exhaustive list of suggestions for safe conduct on #bitcoin-otc.</p>
    <p>The OTC web of trust is not foolproof. Do not rely on the ratings blindly - since the cost of entry into the web of trust is only one positive rating, it is not impossible for a scammer to infiltrate the system, and then create a bunch of bogus accounts who all inter-rate each other. Talk to people on #bitcoin-otc first, make sure they are familiar with the person you're about to trade with, have traded with him successfully in the past, etc.</p>
